# Hackaton-Space-Apps

This reposityr has the objective of storaging our ML code to the NASA's Space Apps Challenge 2021.

We developed a Machine Learning code,  based on the collected data of the polymersâ€™  concentration in sea water and its location by a non-developed device. This equipment placed on the sea surface should collect its water samples and calculate plastic concentration in the area and by a GPS acopled in it, should send information to a satellite about where the debris is. Then, our ML code would calculate the percent of polymers in that location by the database created from our device and will place all this information in another database.
This solves part of the challenge. Because if scientists obtain this information, they can direct their efforts in plastic water treatment to specific locations on the planet. This will be important for enforcing environmental sanctions in countries that dump waste into the sea because we would know how many and where exactly they are throwing it. And, by the reduction of polymers in the ocean,  consequently our water will be cleaner and the sea salt would be reliable and safe for humans to consume
